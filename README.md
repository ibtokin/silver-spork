silver-spork
============

This is a fork of the Django 1.7 tutorial. Eventually the REST API gold-spork will serve as its automated counterpart.

silver-spork will function as a manual input form for news feed inputs (see FatTony repo) and gold-spork will aggregate social media posts from specified users.

**in the not-so-distant future**

Once I've got the whole deployment thing figured out, I'll be working on manual input of social media feed users. My end goal is to create not just an open source library, but a DIY social media aggregator for anyone to create a feed for their employees or followers (Eg: Municipalities, schools, organizations). 

Why? Because if you're trying to reach your students, odds are they're going to see your posts among all the other posts in their news feed. This leads to having to post redundant info on multiple accounts for more exposure.

A school can instead set up a feed, specify which accounts to follow and manually input feed items that can be marked as urgent for a mass push notification instead of a passive feed update.
